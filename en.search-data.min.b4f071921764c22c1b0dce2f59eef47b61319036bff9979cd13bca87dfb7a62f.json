This enables EVPN (Ethernet VPN) functionality directly on your Kubernetes nodes, eliminating the need for external PE routers.\nNetwork Architecture # Traditional vs. OpenPERouter Architecture # In traditional deployments, Kubernetes nodes connect to Top-of-Rack (ToR) switches via VLANs, and external PE routers handle EVPN tunneling. OpenPERouter moves this PE functionality directly into the Kubernetes nodes.\nKey Components # OpenPERouter consists of three main components:\nRouter Pod: Runs FRR in a dedicated network namespace Controller Pod: Manages network configuration and orchestrates the router setup Node Labeler: Assigns persistent node indices for resource allocation Underlay Connectivity # Fabric Integration # OpenPERouter integrates with your network fabric by establishing BGP sessions with external routers (typically ToR switches).\nNetwork Interface Management # OpenPERouter works by moving the physical network interface connected to the ToR switch into the router\u0026rsquo;s network namespace:\nThis allows the router to establish direct BGP sessions with the fabric and receive routing information.\nVTEP IP Assignment # Each OpenPERouter instance is assigned a unique VTEP (Virtual Tunnel End Point) IP address from a configured CIDR range. This VTEP IP serves as the identifier for the router within the fabric.\nOpenPERouter establishes a BGP session with the fabric, advertising its VTEP IP to other routers. The VPN address family is enabled on this session, allowing the exchange of EVPN routes required for overlay connectivity.\nOverlay Networks (VNIs) # Virtual Network Identifiers # OpenPERouter supports the creation of multiple VNIs (Virtual Network Identifiers), each corresponding to a separate EVPN tunnel. This enables multi-tenancy and network segmentation.\nOpenPERouter supports the creation of L3 VNIs, allowing the extension of a routed domain via an EVPN overlay:\nIt supports the creation of L2 VNIs, where the veth is directly connected to a layer 2 domain\nAnd it also supports a mixed scenario, where an L2 domain also belongs to a broader L3 domain mapped to an L3 overlay\nL3 VNI Components # For each Layer 3 VNI, OpenPERouter automatically creates:\nVeth Pair: Named after the VNI (e.g., host-200@pe-200) for host connectivity BGP Session: Configured over the veth pair connecting the router to the host, to allow BGP connectivity with the host Linux VRF: Isolates the routing space for each VNI within the router\u0026rsquo;s network namespace VXLAN Interface: Handles tunnel encapsulation/decapsulation Route Translation: Converts between BGP routes and EVPN Type 5 routes IP Allocation Strategy # The IP addresses for the veth pair are allocated from the configured localcidr for each VNI:\nRouter side: Always gets the first IP in the CIDR (e.g., 192.169.11.0) Host side: Each node gets a different IP from the CIDR, starting from the second value (e.g., 192.169.11.15) This consistent allocation strategy of the router IP simplifies configuration across all nodes, as any BGP-speaking component on the host can use the same IP address for the router side of the veth pair.\nControl Plane Operations # Route Advertisement (Host → Fabric) # When a BGP-speaking component (like MetalLB) advertises a prefix to OpenPERouter:\nThe host advertises the route with the veth interface IP as the next hop OpenPERouter learns the route via the BGP session OpenPERouter translates the route to an EVPN Type 5 route The EVPN route is advertised to the fabric with the local VTEP as the next hop Route Reception (Fabric → Host) # When EVPN Type 5 routes are received from the fabric:\nOpenPERouter installs the routes in the VRF corresponding to the VNI OpenPERouter translates the EVPN routes to BGP routes The BGP routes are advertised to the host via the veth interface The host\u0026rsquo;s BGP-speaking component learns and installs the routes Data Plane Operations # Egress Traffic Flow # Traffic destined for networks learned via EVPN follows this path:\nHost Routing: Traffic is redirected to the veth interface corresponding to the VNI Encapsulation: OpenPERouter encapsulates the traffic in VXLAN packets with the appropriate VNI Fabric Routing: The fabric routes the VXLAN packets to the destination VTEP Delivery: The destination endpoint instance receives and processes the traffic Ingress Traffic Flow # VXLAN packets received from the fabric are processed as follows:\nDecapsulation: OpenPERouter removes the VXLAN header VRF Routing: Traffic is routed within the VRF corresponding to the VNI Host Delivery: Traffic is forwarded to the host via the veth interface Final Routing: The host routes the traffic to the appropriate destination L2 VNI # For each Layer 2 VNI, OpenPERouter automatically creates:\nVeth Pair: Named after the VNI (e.g., host-200@pe-200) for Layer 2 host connectivity Linux VRF: Optional, isolates the routing space for each VNI within the router\u0026rsquo;s network namespace VXLAN Interface: Handles tunnel encapsulation/decapsulation Host Interface Management # Given the Layer 2 nature of these connections, OpenPERouter supports multiple interface management options:\nAttaching to an existing bridge: If a bridge already exists and is used by other components, OpenPERouter can attach the veth interface to it Creating a new bridge: OpenPERouter can create a bridge and attach the veth interface directly to it. Direct veth usage: With the understanding that the veth interface may disappear if the pod gets restarted, the veth can be used directly to extend an existing Layer 2 domain Automatic Bridge Creation # The automatic bridge creation is useful for those scenarios where an existing layer 2 domain is extended automatically through the veth interface: when the router pod is deleted or restarted, the veth interface is removed (and then recreated upon reconciliation), while the bridge remains intact, making it a good candidate for attaching to an existing layer 2 domain (i.e. setting it as master of a macvlan multus interface).\nData Plane Operations # The following sections describe complete Layer 2 and Layer 3 scenarios for reference:\nEgress Traffic Flow # When Layer 2 traffic arrives at the veth interface and the destination belongs to the same subnet, the traffic is encapsulated and directed to the VTEP where the endpoint with the MAC address corresponding to the destination IP is located.\nIf the destination IP is on a different subnet, the traffic is routed to the L3 domain that the VNI is connected to, and it\u0026rsquo;s routed via the L3 VNI corresponding to the VRF that the veth interface is attached to.\nIngress Traffic Flow # The ingress flow follows the reverse path of the egress flow. For Layer 2 traffic, VXLAN packets are decapsulated and forwarded to the appropriate veth interface. For Layer 3 traffic, packets are routed through the VRF and then forwarded to the host via the veth interface. The process is straightforward and doesn\u0026rsquo;t require additional explanation beyond what has already been covered in the egress flow descriptions.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/examples/metallb/","title":"MetalLB Integration","section":"Examples","content":"This example demonstrates how to integrate OpenPERouter with MetalLB to advertise LoadBalancer services across the EVPN fabric, enabling external access to Kubernetes services.\nOverview # MetalLB provides load balancing for Kubernetes services by advertising service IPs via BGP.

Router Pod # The router pod is the core networking component that provides the actual EVPN functionality.\nThe router pod runs as a Daemonset to allow EVPN connectivity to every node.\nPurpose and Responsibilities # The router pod runs FRR in a dedicated network namespace and is responsible for:\nBGP Sessions: Establishing and maintaining BGP sessions with external routers and host components EVPN Route Processing: Handling EVPN Type 5 route advertisement and reception VXLAN Encapsulation: Managing VXLAN tunnel encapsulation and decapsulation Route Translation: Converting between BGP routes and EVPN routes Network Namespace Management: Operating in an isolated network namespace for security and isolation Container Architecture # The router pod consists of two containers:\nFRR Container: Runs the Free Range Routing daemon and handles all BGP and EVPN operations Reloader Sidecar: Provides an HTTP endpoint that accepts FRR configuration updates and triggers configuration reloads The reloader sidecar container enables dynamic configuration updates without requiring pod restarts, allowing the controller to push new FRR configurations as network conditions change.\nNetwork Configuration Requirements # To enable EVPN functionality, FRR requires specific network interfaces and configurations:\nLinux VRF: Creates isolated Layer 3 routing domains for each VNI Linux Bridge: Connects VXLAN interfaces to the VRF for proper traffic flow VXLAN Interface: Handles tunnel encapsulation/decapsulation with the configured VNI VTEP Loopback: Provides the VTEP IP address for tunnel endpoint identification FRR Configuration #
